abstract: This paper investigates how the choice of stochastic approaches and distribution
  assumptions impacts strategic investment decisions in energy planning problems.
  We formulate a two-stage stochastic programming model assuming different distributions
  for the input parameters and show that there is significant discrepancy among the
  associated stochastic solutions and other robust solutions published in the literature.
  To remedy this sensitivity issue, we propose a combined machine learning and distributionally
  robust optimization (DRO) approach which produces more robust and stable strategic
  investment decisions with respect to uncertainty assumptions. DRO is applied to
  deal with ambiguous probability distributions and Machine Learning is used to restrict
  the DRO model to a subset of important uncertain parameters ensuring computational
  tractability. Finally, we perform an out-of-sample simulation process to evaluate
  solutions performances. The Swiss energy system is used as a case study all along
  the paper to validate the approach.
